# Team-58

Our environment setup is running on a CUDA Graphics card with version 12.1 of the CUDA Toolkit on Windows.

We then created a new environment following the PyTorch "Start Locally" instructions, using the command line: 

`pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121`

We have also attached the YAML file to ensure that anyone who wishes to test the code can have an identical environment and package setup.
